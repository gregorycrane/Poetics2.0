# Aristotle, Poetics 2.0

## Project Goals 

This project works towards a truly digital edition of Aristotle's Poetics. While the project will evolve over time, our initial goals including the following:

1. Opening up the Greek text to audiences with no knowledge of the language.

2. Providing new services to advanced researchers on Aristotle.

3. Creating a framework whereby audiences can develop as much command of the source as they need or wish to possess.

4. Structuring our information to serve, as effectively as possible, audiences familiar with many different languages and from many different backgrounds.


## Available Greek Texts

1. The Perseus Digital Library has included [the 1966 Rudolf Kassel edition](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0055%3Asection%3D1447a). This Greek file has not yet been updated and remains in beta code on the local Perseus file structure as: texts/Classics/Aristotle/copyright/aristot.poet_gk.xml. This file opens:
