<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>I propose to treat of Poetry in itself and of its various
kinds, noting the essential quality of each; to inquire into
the structure of the plot as requisite to a good poem;
into the number and nature of the parts of which a
poem is composed ; and similarly into whatever else falls
within the same inquiry. Following, then, the order of
nature, let us begin with the principles which come
first.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Epic poetry and Tragedy, Comedy also and Dithyrambic
poetry, and the music of the flute and of the lyre in
most of their forms, are all in their general conception
modes of imitation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>They differ, however, from one
another in three respects —the medium, the objects, the
manner or mode of imitation, being in each case
distinct.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>For as there are persons who, by conscious art or
mere habit, imitate and represent various objects through
the medium of colour and form, or again by the voice;
so in the arts above mentioned, taken as a whole, the
imitation is produced by rhythm, language, or <gloss>harmony,</gloss>
either singly or combined.


<pb n="9"/>

Thus in the music of the flute and of the lyre,
<gloss>harmony</gloss> and rhythm alone are employed; also in
other arts, such as that of the shepherd’s pipe, which
are essentially similar to these.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>In dancing, rhythm
alone is used without <gloss>harmony</gloss>; for even dancing
imitates character, emotion, and action, by rhythmical
movement.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>There is another art which imitates by means of
language alone, and that either in prose or verse—which

a7» Verse, again, may either combine different metres or con-
sist of but one kind—but this has hitherto been without
aname.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>For there is no common term we could apply to
the mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus and the Socratic
dialogues on the one hand; and, on the other, to
poetic imitations in iambic, elegiac, or any similar
metre. People do, indeed, add the word <gloss>maker</gloss> or
<gloss>poet</gloss> to the name of the metre, and speak of elegiac
poets, or epic (that is, hexameter) poets, as if it were not
the imitation that makes the poet, but the verse that
entitles them all indiscriminately to the name.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>Even
when a treatise on medicine or natural science is brought
out in verse, the name of poet is by custom given to the
author; and yet Homer and Empedocles have nothing in
common but the metre, so that it would be right to.
call the one poet, the other physicist rather than poet.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>On the same principle, even if a writer in his poetic
imitation were to combine all metres, as Chaeremon did
in his Centaur, which is a medley composed of metres

<pb n="11"/>

of all kinds, we should bring him too under the general
term poet. So much then for these distinctions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>There are, again, some arts which employ all the
means above mentioned,—namely, rhythm, tune, and
metre. Such are Dithyrambic and Nomic poetry, and
also Tragedy and Comedy; but between them the
difference is, that in the first two cases these means
are all employed in combination, in the latter, now one
means is employed, now another.

Such, then, are the differences of the arts with respect
to the medium of imitation.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Since the objects of imitation are men in action, and

“®* these men must be either of a higher or a lower type
(for moral character mainly answers to these divisions,
goodness and badness being the distinguishing marks
of moral differences), it follows that we must represent
men either as better than in real life, or as worse, or
as they are. It is the same in painting. Polygnotus
depicted men as nobler than they are, Pauson as less
noble, Dionysius drew them true to life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Now it is evident that each of the modes of imitation
above mentioned will exhibit these differences, and be-
come a distinct kind in imitating objects that are thus
distinct.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Such diversities may be found even in dancing,
flute-playing, and lyre-playing. So again in language,
whether prose or verse unaccompanied by music. Homer,
for example, makes men better than they are; Cleophon
as they are; Hegemon the Thasian, the inventor of
parodies, and Nicochares, the author of the Deiliad, worse
than they are.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>The same thing holds good of Dithyrambs
and Nomes; here too one may portray different types, as

<pb n="13"/>

Timotheus and Philoxenus differed in representing their
Cyclopes. The same distinction marks off Tragedy from
Comedy; for Comedy aims at representing men as worse,
Tragedy as better than in actual life.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>There is still a third difference—the manner in which
each of these objects may be imitated. For the medium
being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may
imitate by narration—in which case he can either take
another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own
person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters
as living and moving before us.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>These, then, as we said at the beginning, are the
three differences which distinguish artistic imitation,—
the medium, the objects, and the manner. So that from
one point of view, Sophocles is an imitator of the same
kind as Homer—for both imitate higher types of
character ; from another point of view, of the same kind
as Aristophanes—for both imitate persons acting and
doing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Hence, some say, the name of <gloss>drama</gloss> is given
to such poems, as representing action. For the same
reason the Dorians claim the invention both of Tragedy
and Comedy. The claim to Comedy is put forward by
the Megarians,—not only by those of Greece proper, who
allege that it originated under their democracy, but also by
the Megarians of Sicily, for the poet Epicharmus, who is
much earlier than Chionides and Magnes, belonged to that
country. Tragedy too is claimed by certain Dorians of the
Peloponnese. In each case they appeal to the evidence of
language. The outlying villages, they say, are by them
called xé@pat, by the Athenians S01: and they assume
that Comedians were so named not from xwpdlevv, ‘to

<pb n="15"/>

revel,’ but because they wandered from village to village
(xara xowpas), being excluded contemptuously from the

14a» city. They add also that the Dorian word for <gloss>doing</gloss>
is Spay, and the Athenian, rpdrrew.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>This may suffice as to the number and nature of the
various modes of imitation.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Poetry in general seems to have sprung from two
causes, each of them lying deep in our nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>First, the
instinct of imitation is implanted in man from childhood,
one difference between him and other animals being
that he is the most imitative of living creatures, and
through imitation learns his earliest lessons; and no less
universal is the pleasure felt in things imitated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>We
have evidence of this in the facts of experience.
Objects which in themselves we view with pain, we
delight to contemplate when reproduced with minute
fidelity: such as the forms of the most ignoble animals
and of dead bodies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>The cause of this again is, that to
learn gives the liveliest pleasure, not only to philosophers
but to men in general; whose capacity, however, of
learning is more limited. Thus the reason why mens
enjoy seeing a likeness is, that in contemplating it they
find themselves learning or inferring, and saying perhaps,
<gloss>Ah, that is he.</gloss></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>For if you happen not to have see
the original, the pleasure will be due not to the imitation
as such, but to the execution, the colouring, or some such
other cause.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next,
there is the instinct for <gloss>harmony</gloss> and rhythm, metres
being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore,
starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their


<pb n="17"/>

special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth
to Poetry.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>Poetry now diverged in two directions, according to
the individual character of the writers. The graver
spirits imitated noble actions, and the actions of
good men. The more trivial sort imitated the actions
of meaner persons, at first composing satires, as
the former did hymns to the gods and the praises of
famous men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>A poem of the satirical kind cannot
indeed be put down to any author earlier than Homer;
though many such writers probably there were. But
from Homer onward, instances can be cited,—his own
Margites, for example, and other similar compositions.
The appropriate metre was also here introduced ; hence
the measure is still called the iambic or lampooning
measure, being that in which people lampooned one
another.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>Thus the older poets were distinguished as
writers of heroic or of lampooning verse.

As, in the serious style, Homer is pre-eminent among
poets, for he alone combined dramatic form with
excellence of imitation, so he too first laid down the
main lines of Comedy, by dramatising the ludicrous
instead of writing personal satire. His Margites bears

uus9a the same relation to Comedy that the Iliad and Odyssey
do to Tragedy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>But when Tragedy and Comedy came
to light, the two classes of poets still followed their
natural bent: the lampooners became writers of Comedy,
and the Epic poets were succeeded by Tragedians,
since the drama was a larger and higher form of
art.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>Whether Tragedy has as yet perfected its proper
c

<pb n="19"/>

types or not; and whether it is to be judged in itself, or
in relation also to the audience,—this raises another
question.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Be that as it may, Tragedy—as also Comedy
—was at first mere improvisation. The one originated
with the authors of the Dithyramb, the other with those
of the phallic songs, which are still in use in many of
our cities. Tragedy advanced by slow degrees; each
new element that showed itself was in turn developed.
Having passed through many changes, it found its natural
form, and there it stopped.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>Aeschylus first introduced a second actor; he dimin-
ished the importance of the Chorus, and assigned the
leading part to the dialogue. Sophocles raised the number
of actors to three, and added scene-painting.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>Moreover,
it was not till late that the short plot was discarded for
one of greater compass, and the grotesque diction of the
earlier satyric form for the stately manner of Tragedy.
The iambic measure then replaced the trochaic tetrameter,
which was originally employed when the poetry was of
the satyric order, and had greater affinities with dancing.
Once dialogue had come in, Nature herself discovered the
appropriate measure.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>For the iambic is, of all measures,
the most colloquial: we see it in the fact that con-
versational speech runs into iambic lines more frequently
than into any other kind of verse; rarely into hexa-
meters, and only when we drop the colloquial in-
tonation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>The additions to the number of <gloss>episodes</gloss>
or acts, and the other accessories of which tradition

<pb n="21"/>

tells, must be taken as already described; for to discuss
them in detail would, doubtless, be a large under-
taking.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Comedy is, as we have said, an imitation of characters
of a lower type,—not, however, in the full sense of the
word bad, the Ludicrous being merely a subdivision of
the ugly. It consists in some defect or ugliness which
is not painful or destructive. To take an obvious
example, the comic mask is ugly and distorted, but does
not imply pain.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>The successive changes through which Tragedy passed,
and the authors of these changes, are well known, whereas
Comedy has had no history, because it was not at first

1449 b treated seriously. It was late before the Archon granted
a comic chorus to a poet; the performers were till then
voluntary. Comedy had already taken definite shape
when comic poets, distinctively so called, are heard of.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Who farnished it with masks, or prologues, or increased
the number of actors,—these and other similar details
remain unknown. As for the plot, it came originally
from Sicily; but of Athenian writers Crates was the
first who, abandoning the <gloss>iambic</gloss> or lampooning form,
generalised his themes and plots.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an
imitation in verse of characters of a higher type. They
differ, in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of
metre, and is narrative in form. They differ, again,
<pb n="23"/>

in their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as
possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the
sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit; whereas the
Epic action has no limits of time. This, then, is a
second point of difference; though at first the same
freedom was admitted in Tragedy as in Epic poetry.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>Of their constituent parts some are common to both,
some peculiar to Tragedy: whoever, therefore, knows
what is good or bad Tragedy, knows also about Epic
poetry. All the elements of an Epic poem are found
in Tragedy, but the elements of a Tragedy are not all
found in the Epic poem.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Of the poetry which imitates in hexameter verse, and
of Comedy, we will speak hereafter. Let us now discuss
Tragedy, resuming its formal definition, as resulting from
what has been already said.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is
serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude ; in language
embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the
several kinds being found in separate parts of the play;
in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and
fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>By
<gloss>language embellished,</gloss> I mean language into which
rhythm, <gloss>harmony,</gloss> and song enter. By the several kinds
in separate parts, I mean, that some parts are rendered
through the medium of verse alone, others again with
the aid of song.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Now as tragic imitation implies persons acting, it neces-
sarily follows, in the first place, that Spectacular equip-
ment will be a part of Tragedy. Next, Song and Diction,
for these are the medium of imitation. By <gloss>Diction</gloss>

<pb n="25"/>

as for <gloss>Song,</gloss> it is a term whose sense every one under-
stands.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>Again, Tragedy is the imitation of an action; and an
action implies personal agents, who necessarily possess
certain distinctive qualities both of character and thought;

40a for it is by these that we qualify actions themselves,
and these—thought and character—are the two natural
causes from which actions spring, and on actions again
all success or failure depends.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Hence, the Plot is the
imitation of the action:—for by plot I here mean the
arrangement of the incidents. By Character I mean
that in virtue of which we ascribe certain qualities to
the agents. Thought is required wherever a statement
is proved, or, it may be, a general truth enunciated.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>Every Tragedy, therefore, must have six parts, which
parts determine its quality—-namely, Plot, Character,
l Diction, Thought, Spectacle, Song. Two of the parts con-
stitute the medium of imitation, one the manner, and three
the objects of imitation. And these complete the list.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>These elements have been employed, we may say, by the
poets to a man; in fact, every play contains Spectacular
elements as well as Character, Plot, Diction, Song, and
Thought.
But most important of all is the structure of theg


<pb n="27"/>

incidents. For Tragedy is an imitation, not of men, but

of an action and of life, and life consists in action, and
its end is a mode of action, not a quality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>Now
character determines men’s qualities, but it is by their
actions that they are happy or the reverse. Dramatic
action, therefore, is not with a view to the representation
of character: character comes in as subsidiary to the
actions. Hence the incidents and the plot are the end of
a tragedy; and the end is the chief thing of all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>Again,
without action there cannot be a tragedy; there may be
without character. The tragedies of most of our modern
poets fail in the rendering of character; and of poets in
general this is often true. It is the same in painting;
and here lies the difference between Zeuxis and Polygnotus.
Polygnotus delineates character well: the style of Zeuxis
is devoid of ethical quality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Again, if you string
together a set of speeches expressive of character, and
well finished in point of diction and thought, you will
not produce the essential tragic effect nearly so well as
with a play which, however deficient in these respects,
yet has a plot and artistically constructed incidents.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>Besides which, the most powerful elements of emotional
interest in Tragedy—Peripeteia or Reversal of the
Situation, and Recognition scenes—are parts of the plot.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>A further proof is, that novices in the art attain to finish
of diction and precision of portraiture before they can
construct the plot. It is the same with almost all
the early poets.

The Plot, then, is the first principle, and, as it were,

<pb n="29"/>

the soul of a tragedy: Character holds the second place.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>1450b A similar fact is seen in painting. The most beautiful
colours, laid on confusedly, will not give as much pleasure
as the chalk outline of a portrait. Thus Tragedy is the
imitation of an action, and of the agents mainly with a
view to the action.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>Third in order is Thought,—that is, the faculty of
saying what is possible and pertinent in given circum-
stances. In the case of oratory, this is the function of
the political art and of the art of rhetoric: and so indeed
the older poets make their characters speak the language
of civic life; the poets of our time, the language of the
rhetoricians.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>Character is that which reveals moral
purpose, showing what kind of things a man chooses or
avoids. Speeches, therefore, which do not make this
manifest, or in which the speaker does not choose or
avoid anything whatever, are not expressive of character.
Thought, on the other hand, is found where something is
proved to be or not to be, or a general maxim is
enunciated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>Fourth among the elements enumerated comes
Diction ; by which I mean, as has been already said, the
expression of the meaning in words; and its essence is
the same both in verse and prose.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
<p>Of the remaining elements Song holds the chief place
among the embellishments.

The Spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of
its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and
connected least with the art of poetry. For the power
of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from
representation and actors. Besides, the production of

<pb n="31"/>

spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage
machinist than on that of the poet.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>These principles being established, let us now discuss
the proper structure of the Plot, since this is the first
and most important thing in Tragedy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Now, according to our definition, Tragedy is an
imitation of an action that is complete, and whole, and
of a certain magnitude; for there may be a whole that
is wanting in magnitude.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>A whole is that which has
a beginning, a middle, and an end. A beginning is that
which does not itself follow anything by causal necessity,
but after which something naturally is or comes to be.
An end, on the contrary, is that which itself naturally
follows some other thing, either by necessity, or as a rule,
but has nothing following it. A middle is that which
follows something as some other thing follows it. A well
constructed plot, therefore, must neither begin nor end
at haphazard, but conform to these principles,

Again, a beautiful object, whether it be a livings
organism or any whole composed of parts, must not
only have an orderly arrangement of parts, but must
also be of a certain magnitude; for beauty depends on
magnitude and order. Hence a very small animal
organism cannot be beautiful; for the view of it is con-
fused, the object being seen in an almost imperceptible
moment of time. Nor, again, can one of vast size be

3451 a beautiful; for as the eye cannot take it all in at once,
the unity and sense of the whole is lost for the spectator ;
as for instance if there were one a thousand miles
long.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>As, therefore, in the case of animate bodies and
organisms a certain magnitude is necessary, and a magni-

<pb n="33"/>


tude which may be easily embraced in one view; so in
the plot, a certain length is necessary, and a length</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>which can be easily embraced by the memory. The

limit of length in relation to dramatic competition and
sensuous presentment, is no part of artistic theory. For
had it been the rule for a hundred tragedies to compete
together, the performance would have been regulated by
the water-clock,—as indeed we are told was formerly
done.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>But the limit as fixed by the nature of the
drama itself is this:—-the greater the length, the
more beautiful will the piece be by reason of its
size, provided that the whole be perspicuous, And
to define the matter roughly, we may say that the
proper magnitude is comprised within such limits, that
the sequence of events, according to the law of probability
or necessity, will admit of a change from bad fortune to
good, or from good fortune to bad.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Unity of plot does not, as some persons think, consist
in the unity of the hero. For infinitely various are the
incidents in one man’s life which cannot be reduced to
unity; and so, too, there are many actions of one man
out of which we cannot make one action.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Hence the
error, as it appears, of all poets who have composed a
Heracleid, a Theseid, or other poems of the kind. They
imagine that as Heracles was one man, the story of
Heracles must also be a unity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>But Homer, as in all
else he is of surpassing merit, here too—whether from
art or natural genius—seems to have happily discerned
the truth. In composing the Odyssey he did not include
all the adventures of Odysseus—such as his wound on

Parnassus, or his feigned madness at the mustering of
D

<pb n="35"/>

the host—incidents between which there was no necessary
or probable connexion: but he made the Odyssey, and
likewise the Diad, to centre round an action that in our
sense of the word is one.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>As therefore, in the other
imitative arts, the imitation is one when the object imitated
is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must
imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union
of the parts being such that, if any one of them is
displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and
disturbed. For a thing whose presence or absence makes
no visible difference, is not an organic part of the
whole.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>It is, moreover, evident from what has been said,
that it is not the function of the poet to relate what
has happened, but what may happen,—what is possible
according to the law of probability or necessity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>The

usib poet and the historian differ not by writing in verse or

in prose. The work of Herodotus might be put into
verse, and it would still be a species of history, with
metre no less than without it. The true difference is
that one relates what has happened, the other what may
happen.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Poetry, therefore, is a more philosophical and
a higher thing than history: for poetry tends to express
the universal, history the particular.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>By the universal
speak or act, according to the law of probability or
necessity; and it is this universality at which poetry
aims in the names she attaches to the personages. The
particular is—for example—what Alcibiades did or
suffered.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>In Comedy this is already apparent: for here
the poet first constructs the plot on the lines of prob-


j

/
<pb n="37"/>

ability, and then inserts characteristic names ;—unlike
the lampooners who write about particular individuals.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>But tragedians still keep to real names, the reason being
that what is possible is credible: what has not happened
we do not at once feel sure to be possible: but what has
happened is manifestly possible: otherwise it would not
have happened.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>Still there are even some tragedies in
which there are only one or two well known names, the rest
being fictitious. In others, none are well known,—as
in Agathon’s Antheus, where incidents and names alike
are fictitious, and yet they give none the less pleasure.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>We must not, therefore, at all costs keep to the received
legends, which are the usual subjects of Tragedy. Indeed,
it would be absurd to attempt it; for even subjects that
are known are known only to a few, and yet give pleasure
to all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>It clearly follows that the poet or <gloss>maker</gloss>
should be the maker of plots rather than of verses ;
since he is a poet because he imitates, and what he
imitates are actions. And even if he chances to take
an historical subject, he is none the less a poet; for
there is no reason why some events that have actually
happened should not conform to the law of the probable
and possible, and in virtue of that quality in them he is
their poet or maker.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>Of all plots and actions the epeisodic are the worst.

ceed one another without probable or necessary sequence.
Bad poets compose such pieces by their own fault, good
poets, to please the players; for, as they write show
pieces for competition, they stretch the plot beyond its
1452a capacity, and are often forced to break the natural con-
tinuity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>
But again, Tragedy is an imitation not only of all
complete action, but of events inspiring fear or pity.
Such an effect is best produced when the events come on
us by surprise ; and the effect is heightened when, at the
same time, they follow as cause and effect.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>The tragic
wonder will then be greater than if they happened of
themselves or by accident ; for even coincidences are most
striking when they have an air of design, We may
instance the statue of Mitys at Argos, which fell upon his
murderer while he was a spectator at a festival, and killed
him. Such events seem not to be due to mere chance.
Plots, therefore, constructed on these principles are
necessarily the best.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>An action which is one and
continuous in the sense above defined, I call Simple, when
the change of fortune takes place without Reversal of

A Complex action is one in which the change is
accompanied by such Reversal, or by Recognition, or
by both.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>These last should arise from the internal
structure of the plot, so that what follows should be the

necessary or probable result of the preceding action. It
makes all the difference whether any given event is a
case of propter hoc or post hoc.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Reversal of the Situation is a change by which
the action veers round to its opposite, subject always
to our rule of probability or necessity. Thus in the
Oedipus, the messenger comes to cheer Oedipus and
free him from his alarms about his mother, but by
revealing who he is, he produces the opposite effect.
Again in the Lynceus, Lynceus is being led away to
his death, and Danaus goes with him, meaning to slay
him; but the outcome of the preceding incidents is that
Danaus is killed and Lynceus saved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Recognition, as the name indicates, is a change from
ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between
the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune.
The best form of recognition is coincident with a Reversal
of the Situation, as in the Oedipus.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>There are indeed other
forms. Even inanimate things of the most trivial kind
may in a sense be objects of recognition. Again, we may
recognise or discover whether a person has done a thing
or not. But the recognition which is most intimately
connected with the plot and action is, as we have said,
the recognition of persons.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>This recognition, combined

1482 > with Reversal, will produce either pity or fear; and actions
producing these effects are those which, by our definition,
Tragedy represents. Moreover, it is upon such situations
that the issues of good or bad fortune will depend.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>Recognition, then, being between persons, it may happen
that one person only is recognised by the other—when
the latter is already known—or it may be necessary that
the recognition should be on both sides. Thus Iphigenia
is revealed to Orestes by the sending of the letter; but
another act of recognition is required to make Orestes
known to Iphigenia.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Two parts, then, of the Plot— Reversal of the Situation

bodily agony, wounds and the like.

<p>The parts of Tragedy which

already mentioned. The quantitative parts—the separate

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>As the sequel to what has already been said, we must
proceed to consider what the poet should aim at, and
what he should avoid, in constructing his plots; and by
what means the specific effect of Tragedy will be produced.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged
not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should,
moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this
being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows
plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune
presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man
brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves
neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again,
that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity :
for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it

1453a possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies

the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear. Nor,

again, should the downfall of the utter villain be ex-
hibited. A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy
the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor
fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear
by the misfortune of a man like ourselves. Such an
event, therefore, will be neither pitiful nor terrible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>There remains, then, the character between these two

extremes,—that of a man who is not eminently good and

just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice
or depravity, but by some error or frailty. He must
be one who is highly renowned and prosperous,—a

<pb n="47"/>



personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious
men of such families.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>A well constructed plot should, therefore, be single
in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The
change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but,
reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as
the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty,
in a character either such as we have described, or better
rather than worse.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>The practice of the stage bears out
our view. At first the poets recounted any legend that
came in their way. Now, the best tragedies are founded
on the story of a few houses,—on the fortunes of Alemaeon,
Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those
others who have done or suffered something terrible. A
tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art
should be of this construction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Hence they are in error
who censure Euripides just because he follows this
principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily.
It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof
is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such
plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect ;
and Euripides, faulty though he may be in the general
management of his subject, yet is felt to be the most
tragic of the poets.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which
some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double
thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the
good and for the bad. It is accounted the best because
of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided
in what he writes by the wishes of his audience. Thes
pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic

<pb n="49"/>

pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those
who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies—like Orestes
and Aegisthus—quit the stage as friends at the close,
and no one slays or is slain.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Fear and pity may be aroused by spectacular means ;

49° but they may also result from the inner structure of the
piece, which is the better way, and indicates a superior
poet. For the plot ought to be so constructed that, even
without the aid of the eye, he who hears the tale told
will thrill with horror and melt to pity at what takes
place. This is the impression we should receive from
hearing the story of the Oedipus.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>But to produce this
effect by the mere spectacle is a less artistic method,
and dependent on extraneous aids. Those who employ
spectacular means to create a sense not of the terrible
but only of the monstrous, are strangers to the purpose
of Tragedy ; for we must not demand of Tragedy any and
every kind of pleasure, but only that which is proper
to it. And since the pleasure which the poet should s
afford is that which comes from pity and fear through
imitation, it is evident that this quality must be impressed
upon the incidents. ,

Let us then determine what are the circumstances
which strike us as terrible or pitiful.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Actions capable of this effect must happen between
persons who are either friends or enemies or indifferent
to one another. If an enemy kills an enemy, there is
nothing to excite pity either in the act or the intention,
—except so far as the suffering in itself is pitiful. So
again with indifferent persons. But when the tragic

incident occurs between those who are near or dear to
E

<pb n="51"/>

one another—if, for example, a brother kills, or intends to
kill, a brother, a son his father, a mother her son, a son
his mother, or any other deed of the kind is done—these
are the situations to be looked for by the poet. He may not
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>indeed destroy the framework of the received legends—the
fact, for instance, that Clytemnestra was slain by Orestes
and Eriphyle by Alemaeon—but he ought to showinvention
of his own,and skilfully handle the traditional material. Let
us explain more clearly what is meant by skilful handling.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>The action may be done consciously and with know-
ledge of the persons, in the manner of the older poets.
It is thus too that Euripides makes Medea slay her
children. Or, again, the deed of horror may be done,
but done in ignorance, and the tie of kinship or friend-
ship be discovered afterwards. The Oedipus of Sophocles
is an example. Here, indeed, the incident is outside
the drama proper; but cases occur where it falls within
the action of the play: one may cite the Alcmaeon of
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>Astydamas,or Telegonus in the Wounded Odysseus, Again,
there is a third case,—to be about to act with knowledge
of the persons and then not to act. The fourth case is>
when some one is about to do an irreparable deed through
ignorance, and makes the discovery before it is done. These
are the only possible ways. For the deed must either be
done or not done,—and that wittingly or unwittingly.
But of all these ways, to be about to act knowing the
persons, and then not to act, is the worst. It is shocking
without being tragic, for no disaster follows. It is, there-
1464 a fore, never, or very rarely, found in poetry. One instance,
however, is in the Antigone, where Haemon threatens to
kill Creon.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>The next and better way is that the deed

<pb n="53"/>

should be perpetrated. Still better, that it should be
perpetrated in ignorance, and the discovery made after-
wards. There is then nothing to shock us, while the
discovery produces a startling effect.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>The last case is the
best, as when in the Cresphontes Merope is about to slay
her son, but, recognising who he is, spares his life. So
in the Iphigenia, the sister recognises the brother just in
time. Again in the Helle, the son recognises the mother
when on the point of giving her up. This, then, is why
a few families only, as has been already observed, furnish
the subjects of tragedy. It was not art, but happy
chance, that led the poets in search of subjects to
impress the tragic quality upon their plots. They are
compelled, therefore, to have recourse to those houses
whose history contains moving incidents like these.

Enough has now been said concerning the structure
of the incidents, and the right kind of plot.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>In respect of Character there are four things to be
aimed at. First, and most important, it must be good.
Now any speech or action that manifests moral purpose
of any kind will be expressive of character: the character
will be good if the purpose is good. This rule is relative
to each class. Even a woman may be good, and also a
slave; though the woman may be said to be an inferior
being, and the slave quite worthless.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>The second thing
to aim at is propriety. There is a type of manly valour;
but valour in a woman, or unscrupulous cleverness, is in-
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>appropriate, Thirdly, character must be true to life: for

<pb n="55"/>
this is a distinct thing from goodness and propriety, as here
described.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>The fourth point is consistency: for though
the subject of the imitation, who suggested the type,
be inconsistent, still he must be consistently inconsistent. '
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>As an example of motiveless degradation of character, we
have Menelaus in the Orestes: of character indecorous
and inappropriate, the lament of Odysseus in the Scylla,
and the speech of Melanippe: of inconsistency, the
Iphigenia at Aulis—for Iphigenia the suppliant in no
way resembles her later self.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>As in the structure of the plot, so too in the por-
traiture of character, the poet should always aim either
at the necessary or the probable. Thus a person of a
given character should speak or act in a given way, by
the rule either of necessity or of probability; just as
this event should follow that by necessary or probable
sequence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>It is therefore evident that the unravelling
of the plot, no less than the complication, must arise out

1454 of the plot itself, it must not be brought about by the
Deus ex Machina—as in the Medea, or in the Return of
the Greeks in the Iliad. The Deus ex Machina should
be employed only for events external to the drama,—
for antecedent or subsequent events, which lie beyond

the range of human knowledge, and which require to be

<pb n="57"/>
XVI


reported or foretold ; for to the gods we ascribe the power
of seeing all things. Within the action there must be
nothing irrational. If the irrational cannot be excluded,
it should be outside the scope of the tragedy. Such is
the irrational element in the Oedipus of Sophocles.

Again, since Tragedy is an imitation of persons whos .

are above the common level, the example of good portrait-
painters should be followed. They, while reproducing
the distinctive form of the original, make a likeness
which is true to life and yet more beautiful. So too
the poet, in representing men who are irascible or
indolent, or have other defects of character, should
preserve the type and yet ennoble it. In this way
Achilles is portrayed by Agathon and Homer.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>These then are rules the poet should observe. Nor
should he neglect those appeals to the senses, which,
though not among the essentials, are the concomitants of

poetry; for here too there is much room for error. But

of this enough has been said in our published treatises.
</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>What Recognition is has been already explained.
We will now enumerate its kinds.

First, the least artistic form, which, from poverty of
wit, is most commonly employed—recognition by signs.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Of these some are congenital,—such as <gloss>the spear which
the earth-born race bear on their bodies,</gloss> or the stars
introduced by Carcinus in his Thyestes. Others are
acquired after birth; and of these some are bodily marks,
as scars; some external tokens, as necklaces, or the little
ark in the Tyro by which the discovery is effected. Evens
these admit of more or less skilful treatment. Thus in
the recognition of Odysseus by his scar, the discovery is


<pb n="59"/>

made in one way by the nurse, in another by the swine-
herds, The use of tokens for the express purpose of proof
—and, indeed, any formal proof with or without tokens
—is a less artistic mode of recognition. A better kind
is that which comes about by a turn of incident, as in
the Bath Scene in the Odyssey.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Next come the recognitions invented at will by the
poet, and on that account wanting in art. For example,
Orestes in the Iphigenia reveals the fact that he is
Orestes. She, indeed, makes herself known by the letter;
but he, by speaking himself, and saying what the poet,
not what the plot requires. This, therefore, is nearly
allied to the fault above mentioned :—for Orestes might
as well have brought tokens with him. Another similar
instance is the <gloss>voice of the shuttle</gloss> in the Tereus of
Sophocles.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>
1485a The third kind depends on memory when the sight of
some object awakens a feeling: as in the Cyprians of
Dicaeogenes, where the hero breaks into tears on seeing
the picture; or again in the ‘Lay of Alcinous, where
Odysseus, hearing the minstrel play the lyre, recalls the
past and weeps; and hence the recognition.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>The fourth kind is by process of reasoning. Thus in
the Choéphori:—‘Some one resembling me has come:
no one resembles me but Orestes: therefore Orestes has
come.’ Such too is the discovery made by Iphigenia
in the play of Polyidus the Sophist. It was a natural
reflexion for Orestes to make, ‘So I too must die at the
altar like my sister. So, again, in the Tydeus of
Theodectes, the father says, ‘I came to find my son, and
women, on seeing the place, inferred their fate :—‘ Here


<pb n="61"/>

we are doomed to die, for here we were cast forth.’
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>Again, there is a composite kind of recognition involving
false inference on the part of one of the characters, as in
the Odysseus Disguised as a Messenger. A said <add>that
no one else was able to bend the bow; ... hence B
(the disguised Odysseus) imagined that A would</add>
recognise the bow which, in fact, he had not seen; and
to bring about a recognition by this means—the expecta-
tion that A would recognise the bow—is false inference.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>But, of all recognitions, the best is that which arises
from the incidents themselves, where the startling dis-
covery is made by natural means. Such is that in the
Oedipus of Sophocles, and in the Iphigenia; for it was
natural that Iphigenia should wish to dispatch a letter.
These recognitions alone dispense with the artificial aid
of tokens or amulets. Next come the recognitions by
process of reasoning.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>In constructing the plot and working it out with
the proper diction, the poet should place the scene,
as far as possible, before his eyes. In this way, seeing
everything with the utmost vividness, as if he were a
spectator of the action, he will discover what is in keeping
with it, and be most unlikely to overlook inconsistencies.
The need of such a rule is shown by the fault found in
Carcinus, Amphiaraus was on his way from the temple.
This fact escaped the observation of one who did not see
the situation. On the stage, however, the piece failed,
the audience being offended at the oversight.

Again, the poet should work out his play, to the
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>best of his power, with appropriate gestures; for

<pb n="63"/>

those who feel emotion are most convincing through
natural sympathy with the characters they represent;
and one who is agitated storms, one who is angry rages,
with the most life-like reality. Hence poetry implies
either a happy gift of nature or a strain of madness. In )
the one case a man can take the mould of any character;
in the other, he is lifted out of his proper self. ead</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>As for the story, whether the poet takes it ready

1455 > made or constructs it for himself, he should first sketch
its general outline, and then fill in the episodes and
amplify in detail. The general plan may be illustrated by
the Iphigenia. A young girl is sacrificed ; she disappears
mysteriously from the eyes of those who sacrificed her ;
she is transported to ancther country, where the custom is
to offer up all strangers to the goddess. To this ministry
she is appointed. Some time later her own brother
chances to arrive. The fact that the oracle for some reason
ordered him to go there, is outside the general plan of
the play. The purpose, again, of his coming is outside the
action proper. However, he comes, he is seized, and, when
on the point of being sacrificed, reveals who he is. The
mode of recognition may be either that of Euripides or of
Polyidus, in whose play he exclaims very naturally :—
<gloss>So it was not my sister only, but I too, who was doomed
to be sacrificed</gloss>; and by that remark he is saved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>After this, the names being once given, it remains
to fill in the episodes, We must see that they are
relevant to the action. In the case of Orestes, for
example, there is the madness which led to his capture,
and his deliverance by means of the purificatory rite.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>In the drama, the episodes are short, but it is these that

<pb n="65"/>
’

*XVIII


give extension to Epic poetry. Thus the story of the
Odyssey can be stated briefly. A certain man is absent
from home for many years; he is jealously watched by
Poseidon, and left desolate. Meanwhile his home is in
a wretched plight—suitors are wasting his substance and
plotting against his son. At length, tempest-tost, he him-
self arrives; he makes certain persons acquainted with
him; he attacks the suitors with his own hand, and is
himself preserved while he destroys them. This is the
essence of the plot; the rest is episode.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Every tragedy falls into two parts,—Complication
and Unravelling or Dénouement. Incidents extraneous
to the action are frequently combined with a portion of
the action proper, to form the Complication; the rest is
the Unravelling. By the Complication I mean all that
extends from the beginning of the action to the part
which marks the turning-point to good or bad fortune.
The Unravelling is that which extends from the
beginning of the change to the end. Thus, in the
Lynceus of Theodectes, the Complication consists of the
incidents presupposed in the drama, the seizure of the
child, and then again * *  <add>The Unravelling</add> extends
from the accusation of murder to the end.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>There are four kinds of Tragedy, the Complex, depend-
ing entirely on Reversal of the Situation and Recognition ;



<pb n="67"/>

1456a the Pathetic (where the motive is passion),—such as the
tragedies on Ajax and Ixion; the Ethical (where the
motives are ethical)——such as the Phthiotides and the
Peleus. The fourth kind is the Simple <add>We here
exclude the purely spectacular element</add>, exemplified by
the Phorcides, the Prometheus, and scenes laid in Hades.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>The poet should endeavour, if possible, to combine all
poetic elements; or failing that, the greatest number and
those the most important; the more so, in face of the
cavilling criticism of the day. For whereas there have
hitherto been good poets, each in his own branch, the
critics now expect one man to surpass all others in their
several lines of excellence.

In speaking of a tragedy as the same or different, the
best test to take is the plot. Identity exists where the
Complication and Unravelling are the same. Many poets
tie the knot well, but unravel it ill. Both arts, how-
ever, should always be mastered.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Again, the poet should remember what has been often
said, and not make an Epic structure into a Tragedy—
by an Epic structure I mean one with a multiplicity of
plots—as if, for instance, you were to make a tragedy
out of the entire story of the Iliad. In the Epic poem,
owing to its length, each part assumes its proper
magnitude. In the drama the result is far from
answering to the poet’s expectation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>The proof is that
the poets who have dramatised the whole story of the
Fall of Troy, instead of selecting portions, like Euripides ;
or who have taken the whole tale of Niobe, and not a
part of her story, like Aeschylus, either fail utterly or
meet with poor success on the stage. Even Agathon

<pb n="69"/>

has been known to fail from this one defect, In his
Reversals of the Situation, however, he shows a marvellous
skill in the effort to hit the popular taste——to produce a
tragic effect that satisfies the moral sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>This effect is
produced when the clever rogue, like Sisyphus, is out-

The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the
actors; it should be an integral part of the whole, and
share in the action, in the manner not of Euripides but
of Sophocles. As for the later poets, their choral songs
pertain as little to the subject of the piece as to that of
any other tragedy. They are, therefore, sung as mere
interludes,—a practice first begun by Agathon. Yet
what difference is there between introducing such choral
interludes, and transferring a speech, or even a whole act,
from one play to another ?

other parts of Tragedy having been already discussed.
Concerning Thought, we may assume what is said in
the Rhetoric, to which inquiry the subject more strictly
belongs. Under Thought is included every effect which

<p>has to be produced by speech, the subdivisions being,—
proof and refutation ; the excitation of the feelings, such

<p>importance or its opposite. Now, it is evident that
the dramatic incidents must be treated from the same
points of view as the dramatic speeches, when the object
is to evoke the sense of pity, fear, importance, or prob-
ability. The only difference is, that the incidents
should speak for themselves without verbal exposition; —
while the effects aimed at in speech should be pro-
duced by the speaker, and as a result of the speech.
For what were the business of a speaker, if the Thought
were revealed quite apart from what he says ?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Next, as regards Diction. One branch of the inquiry
treats of the Modes of Utterance, But this province
of knowledge belongs to the art of Delivery. and to
the masters of that science. It includes, for instance,
—what is a command, a prayer, a statement, a threat,
a question, an answer, and so forth. </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>To know or not
to know these things involves no serious censure upon
the poet's art. For who can admit the fault imputed
to Homer by Protagoras,—that in the words, <gloss>Sing, goddess, of the wrath,</gloss> he gives a command under the
idea that he utters a prayer? For to tell some one to
do a thing or not to do it is, he says,a command. We
may, therefore, pass this over as an inquiry that belongs
to another art, not to poetry.

that which with such impact has by itself no sound,

A Syllable is a non-significant sound, composed of a

<p>A Noun is a composite significant sound, not marking
time, of which no part is in itself significant: for in
double or compound words we do not employ the
separate parts as if each were in itself significant. Thus
in Theodorus, ‘ god-given, the δῶρον or <gloss>gift</gloss> is not in
itself significant.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>A Verb is a composite significant sound, marking
time, in which, as in the noun, no part is in itself signi-
ficant. For <gloss>man,</gloss> or <gloss>white</gloss> does not express the idea
of <gloss>when</gloss>; but <gloss>he walks,</gloss> or <gloss>he has walked</gloss> does
connote time, present or past.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>Inflexion belongs both to the noun and verb, and
expresses either the relation ‘of, ‘to, or the like; or
that of number, whether one or many, as <gloss>man</gloss> or
<gloss>men</gloss>; or the modes or tones in actual delivery, eg. a
question or a command. <gloss>Did he go?</gloss> and <gloss>go</gloss> are
verbal inflexions of this kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>A Sentence or Phrase is a composite significant
sound, some at least of whose parts are in themselves
significant ; for not every such group of words consists
of verbs and nouns—<gloss>the definition of man,</gloss> for example

a unity in two ways,—either as signifying one thing, or

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Words are of two kinds, simple and double. By
simple I mean those composed of non-significant elements,
such as γῆ. By double or compound, those composed
either of a significant and non-significant element
(though within the whole word no element is significant),
or of elements that are both significant. A word may
likewise be triple, quadruple, or multiple in form, like

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>By a current or proper word I mean one which is
in general use among a people; by a strange word, one
which is in use in another country. Plainly, therefore,
the same word may be at once strange and current, but
not in relation to the same people. The word oiyuvoy,
‘lance, is to the Cyprians a current term but to us a
strange one.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Metaphor is the application of an alien name by

<p>proportion. Thus from genus to species, as: <gloss>There lies
my ship</gloss>; for lying at anchor is a species of lying.
From species to genus, as: <gloss>Verily ten thousand noble
deeds hath Odysseus wrought</gloss>; for ten thousand is a
species of large number, and is here used for a large
number generally. From species to species, as: <gloss>With
blade of bronze drew away the life,</gloss> and <gloss>Cleft the water
with the vessel of unyielding bronze.</gloss> Here dpvcau, <gloss>to
draw away,</gloss> is used for ταμεῖν, <gloss>to cleave</gloss>, and ταμεῖν
again for ἀρύσαι:,—each being a species of taking away.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>
Analogy or proportion is when the second term is to the
first as the fourth to the third. We may then use the
fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth.
Sometimes too we qualify the metaphor by adding the
term to which the proper word is relative. Thus the
cup is to Dionysus as the shield to Ares. The cup may,
therefore, be called <gloss>the shield of Dionysus,</gloss> and the
shield <gloss>the cup of Ares.</gloss> Or, again, as old age is to life,
so is evening to day. Evening may therefore be called
<gloss>the old age of the day,</gloss> and old age, <gloss>the evening of
life</gloss>, or, in the phrase of Empedocles, <gloss>life’s setting sun.</gloss>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>For some of the terms of the proportion there is at times
no word in existence; still the metaphor may be used.
For instance, to scatter seed is called sowing: but the
action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless. Still
this process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing
to the seed. Hence the expression of the poet <gloss>sowing
the god-created light.</gloss></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>There is another way in which
this kind of metaphor may be employed. We may apply
an alien term, and then deny of that term one of its

proper attributes; as if we were to call the shield, nct
<gloss>the cup of Ares,</gloss> but <gloss>the wineless cup.</gloss>

<add>An ornamental word . . .</add></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>A newly-coined word is one which has never been
even in local use, but is adopted by the poet himself.
Some such words there appear to be: as ἐρνύγες,
<gloss>sprouters</gloss>, for κέρατα, <gloss>horns,</gloss> and ἀρητήρ, <gloss>supplicator</gloss>,
for ἱερεύς, <gloss>priest.</gloss></p></div>

<p>1459a A word is lengthened when its own vowel is exchanged
for a longer one, or when a syllable is inserted. A
word is contracted when some part of it is removed.
Instances of lengthening are,—zdAnos for moAews, and
TAnuddem for TndeiSou: of contraction,—xpi, 6a, and
dy, as in pia yiveras aypotépwy dy.</p></div>

<p>An altered word is one in which part of the ordinary

long, namely 7 and w, and—of vowels that admit of
lengthening—those in a. Thus the number of letters in
which nouns masculine and feminine end is the same;
for y and £ are equivalent to endings ins. No noun ends
in a mute or a vowel short by nature. Three only end in

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>The perfection of style is to be clear without being
mean. The clearest style is that which uses only current
or proper words; at the same time it is mean :—witness
the poetry of Cleophon and of Sthenelus. That diction,



<pb n="83"/>

on the other hand, is lofty and raised above the common-
place which employs unusual words. By unusual, I
mean strange (or rare) words, metaphorical, lengthened,—
anything, in short, that differs from the normal idiom.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Yet a style wholly composed of such words is either a
riddle or a jargon; a riddle, if it consists of metaphors ;
a jargon, if it consists of strange (or rare) words. For the
essence of a riddle is to express true facts under im-
possible combinations. Now this cannot be done by any
arrangement of ordinary words, but by the use of meta-
phor it can. Such is the riddle:—<gloss>A man I saw who
on another man had glued the bronze by aid of fire,</gloss> and
others of the same kind. A diction that is made up of
strange (or rare) terms is a jargon.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>A certain infusion,
therefore, of these elements is necessary to style; for the
strange (or rare) word, the metaphorical, the ornamental,
and the other kinds above mentioned, will raise it above
the commonplace and mean, while the use of proper
words will make it perspicuous.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>But nothing contributes

1458 more to produce a clearness of diction that is remote
from commonness than the lengthening, contraction, and
alteration of words. For by deviating in exceptional
cases from the normal idiom, the language will gain
distinction; while, at the same time, the partial con-
formity with usage will give perspicuity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>The critics,
therefore, are in error who censure these licenses of
speech, and hold the author up to ridicule Thus
Eucleides, the elder, declared that it would be an easy
matter to be a poet if you might lengthen syllables at
will He caricatured the practice in the very form of
his diction, as in the verse:

<pb n="85"/>

Ἐπιχάρην εἶδον Μαραθῶνάδε βαδίξοντα,
or,
οὐκ ἄν γ᾽ ἐράμενος τὸν ἐκείνου ἐλλέβορον.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>To employ such license at all obtrusively is, no doubt,
grotesque; but in any mode of poetic diction there
must be moderation. Even metaphors, strange (or rare)
words, or any similar forms of speech, would produce
the like effect if used without propriety and with the
express purpose of being ludicrous.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>How great a differ-
ence is made by the appropriate use of lengthening, may
be seen in Epic poetry by the insertion of ordinary forms
in the verse. So, again, if we take a strange (or rare)
word, a metaphor, or any similar mode of expression,
and replace it by the current or proper term, the truth
of our observation will be manifest. For example
Aeschylus and Euripides each composed the same iambic
line. But the alteration of a single word by Euripides,
who employed the rarer term instead of the ordinary
one, makes one verse appear beautiful and the other
trivial. Aeschylus in his Philoctetes says :
φαγέδαινα «δ᾽-- ἧ μου σάρκας ἐσθίει ποδός·

Euripides substitutesθοινᾶται: <gloss>feasts on</gloss> for ἐσθίει
<gloss>feeds on.</gloss> Again, in the line,

νῦν δέ μ᾽ ἐὼν μικρός τε καὶ ἀσθενικὸς καὶ ἀεικής.

the difference will be felt if we substitute the common
words,

νῦν δέ μ᾽ ἐὼν μικρός τε καὶ ἀσθενικὸς καὶ ἀειδής.

<pb n="87"/>

Or, if for the line,

δίφρον ἀεικέλιον καταθεὶς ὀλίγην τε τράπεζαν,

we read,

δίφρον μοχθηρὸν καταθεὶς μικράν τε τράπεξαν.
Or, for ἠιόνες βούωσιν, ἠιόνες κράξουσιν.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>Again, Ariphrades ridiculed the tragedians for using
phrases which no one would employ in ordinary speech :
for example, Swudrov dio instead of ἀπὸ δωμάτων,

1459a σέθεν, ἐγὼ δέ νιν, ᾿Αχιλλέως πέρι instead of περὶ

᾿Ἀχιλλέως, and the like. It is precisely because such
phrases are not part of the current idiom that they
give distinction to the style. This, however, he failed
to see,</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>It is a great matter to observe propriety in these
several modes of expression, as also in compound words,
strange (or rare) words, and so forth. But the greatest
thing by far is to have a command of metaphor. This
alone cannot be imparted by another; it is the mark of
genius, for to make good metaphors implies an eye for
resemblances,</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>Of the various kinds of words, the compound are
best adapted to dithyrambs, rare words to heroic poetry,
metaphors to iambic. In heroic poetry, indeed, all
these varieties are serviceable. But in iambic verse,
which reproduces, as far as may be, familiar speech, the
most appropriate words are those which are found even
in prose. These are,—the current or proper, the meta-
phorical, the ornamental.

Concerning Tragedy and imitation by means of
action this may suffice.

<pb n="89"/>

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>As to that poetic imitation which is narrative in
form and employs a single metre, the plot manifestly
ought, as in a tragedy, to be constructed on dramatic
principles. It should have for its subject a single
action, whole and complete, with a beginning, a middle,
and anend. It will thus resemble a living organism
in all its unity, and produce the pleasure proper to
it. It will differ in structure from historical composi-
tions, which of necessity present not a single action,
but a single period, and all that happened within
that period to one person or to many, little connected
together as the events may be.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>For as the sea-fight at
Salamis and the battle with the Carthaginians in Sicily
took place at the same time, but did not tend to any one
result, so in the sequence of events, one thing sometimes
follows another, and yet no single result is thereby
produced. Such is the practice, we may say, of
most poets.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Here again, then, as has been already
observed, the transcendent excellence of Homer is
manifest. He never attempts to make the whole war of
Troy the subject of his poem, though that war had a
beginning and an end. It would have been too vast a
theme, and not easily embraced in a single view. If,
again, he had kept it within moderate limits, it must
have been over-complicated by the variety of the in-
cidents. As it is, he detaches a single portion, and
admits as episodes many events from the general story
of the war—such as the Catalogue of the ships and
others—thus diversifying the poem. All other poets
uso» take a single hero, a single period, or an action single
indeed, but with a multiplicity of parts. Thus did the

</p></div>
<pb n="91"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>author of the Cypria and of the Little Iliad. For this
reason the Iliad and the Odyssey each furnish the
subject of one tragedy, or, at most, of two; while the
Cypria supplies materials for many, and the Little Iliad
for eight—the Award of the Arms, the Philoctetes, the
Neoptolemus, the Eurypylus, the Mendicant Odysseus,
the Laconian Women, the Fall of Ilium, the Departure
of the Fleet.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Again, Epic poetry must have as many kinds as
Tragedy: it must be simple, or complex, or <gloss>ethical,</gloss>
or <gloss>pathetic.</gloss> The parts also, with the exception of
song and spectacle, are the same; for it requires
Reversals of the Situation, Recognitions, and Scenes of
Suffering.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Moreover, the thoughts and the diction must
be artistic. In all these respects Homer is our earliest
and sufficient model. Indeed each of his poems has a
twofold character. The Iliad is at once simple and
<gloss>pathetic,</gloss> and the Odyssey complex (for Recognition
scenes run through it), and at the same time <gloss>ethical.</gloss>
Moreover, in diction and thought they are supreme.

Epic poetry differs from Tragedy in the scale ons
which it is constructed, and in its metre. As regards
scale or length, we have already laid down an adequate
limit :—the beginning and the end must be capable of
being brought within a single view. This condition
will be satisfied by poems on a smaller scale than the
old epics, and answering in length to the group of
tragedies presented at a single sitting.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>Epic poetry has, however, a great—a special—
capacity for enlarging its dimensions, and we can see the
reason. In Tragedy we cannot imitate several lines of

<pb n="93"/>

actions carried on at one and the same time; we must
confine ourselves to the action on the stage and the part
taken by the players. But in Epic poetry, owing to the
narrative form, many events simultaneously transacted
can be presented; and these, if relevant to the subject,
add mass and dignity to the poem. The Epic has here
an advantage, and one that conduces to grandeur of
effect, to diverting the mind of the hearer, and relieving
the story with varying episodes. For sameness of
incident soon produces satiety, and makes tragedies fail
on the stage.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>As for the metre, the heroic measure has proved its
fitness by the test of experience. If a narrative poem
in any other metre or in many metres were now com-
posed, it would be found incongruous. For of all
measures the heroic is the stateliest and the most
massive; and hence it most readily admits rare words
and metaphors, which is another point in which the
narrative form of imitation stands alone. On the other

1460a hand, the iambic and the trochaic tetrameter are stirring
measures, the latter being akin to dancing, the former
expressive of action.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Still more absurd would it be to
mix together different metres, as was done by Chaeremon.
Hence no one has ever composed a poem on a great scale
in any other than heroic verse. Nature herself, as we
have said, teaches the choice of the proper measure.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>Homer, admirable in all respects, has the special merit
of being the only poet who rightly appreciates the part
he should take himself. The poet should speak as little
as possible in his own person, for it is not this that makes
him an imitator. Other poets appear themselves upon

<pb n="95"/>

the scene throughout, and imitate but little and rarely.
Homer, after a few prefatory words, at once brings in
α man, or woman, or other personage; none of them
wanting in characteristic qualities, but each with a
character of his own.

The element of the wonderful is required in Tragedy. 8 )
The irrational, on which the wonderful depends for its
chief effects, has wider scope in Epic poetry, because there
the person acting is not seen. Thus, the pursuit of
Hector would be ludicrous if placed upon the stage—the
Greeks standing still and not joining in the pursuit, and
Achilles waving them back. But in the Epic poem the
absurdity passes unnoticed. Now the wonderful is
pleasing: as may be inferred from the fact that every
one tells a story with some addition of his own,
knowing that his hearers like it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>It is Homer who
has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies
skilfully. The secret of it lies in a fallacy. For,
assuming that if one thing is or becomes, a second is
or becomes, men imagine that, if the second is, the first
likewise is or becomes. But this is a false inference.
Hence, where the first thing is untrue, it is quite un-
necessary, provided the second be true, to add that the
first is or has become, For the mind, knowing the
second to be true, falsely infers the truth of the first.
There is an example of this in the Bath Scene of the
Odyssey.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>Accordingly, the poet should prefer probable im-
possibilities to improbable possibilities. The tragic plot
must not be composed. of irrational parts. Everything

<pb n="97"/>

irrational should, if possible, be excluded; or, at all
events, it should lie outside the action of the play (as,
in the Oedipus, the hero’s ignorance as to the manner
of Laius’ death); not within the drama,—as in the
Electra, the messenger’s account of the Pythian games ;
or, a8 in the Mysians, the man who has come from Tegea
to Mysia and is still speechless. The plea that otherwise
the plot would have been ruined, is ridiculous; such a
plot should not in the first instance be constructed.
But once the irrational has been introduced and an air
of likelihood imparted to it, we must accept it in spite of
the absurdity. Take even the irrational incidents in the
Odyssey, where Odysseus is left upon the shore of Ithaca.
How intolerable even these might have been would be
apparent if an inferior poet were to treat the subject.

ueod As it is, the absurdity is veiled by the poetic charm
‘with which the poet invests it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>The diction should be elaborated in the pauses of
the action, where there is no expression of character
or thought. For, conversely, character and thought are
merely obscured by a diction that is over brilliant.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>concede to the poets. Add to this, that the standard of
correctness is not the same in poetry and politics, any
more than in poetry and any other art. Within the art
of poetry itself there are two kinds of faults,—those
which touch its essence, and those which are accidental.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>If a poet has chosen to imitate something, <add>but has
imitated it incorrectly</add> through want of capacity, the
error is inherent in the poetry. But if the failure is
due to a wrong choice—if he has represented a horse
as throwing out both his off legs at once, or introduced
technical inaccuracies in medicine, for example, or in
any other art—the error is not essential to the poetry.
These are the points of view from which we should
consider and answer the objections raised by the
critics.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>First as to matters which concern the poet’s own
art. If he describes the impossible, he is guilty of
an error; but the error may be justified, if the end
of the art be thereby attained (the end being that
already mentioned),—if, that is, the effect of this or
any other part of the poem is thus rendered more
striking. A case in point is the pursuit of Hector.
If, however, the end might have been as well, or better,
attained without violating the special rules of the poetic
art, the error is not justified: for every kind of error
should, if possible, be avoided.

Again, does the error touch the essentials of the
poetic art, or some accident of it? For example,—not
to know that a hind has no horns is a less serious matter
than to paint it inartistically.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Further, if it be objected that the description is not

<pb n="101"/>

true to fact, the poet may perhaps reply,—<gloss>But the
objects are as they ought to be</gloss>: just as Sophocles said
that he drew men as they ought to be; Euripides, as
they are. In this way the objection may be met.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>If,
however, the representation be of neither kind, the poet
may answer,—<gloss>This is how men say the thing is.</gloss> This
applies to tales about the gods. It may well be that
these stories are not higher than fact nor yet true to

1481a fact: they are, very possibly, what Xenophanes says of
them. But anyhow, <gloss>this is what is said</gloss>. Again, a
description may be no better than the fact: <gloss>still, it was
the fact</gloss>; as in the passage about the arms: <gloss>Upright
upon their butt-ends stood the spears</gloss>, This was the
custom then, as it now is among the Illyrians.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>Again, in examining whether what has been said or
done by some one is poetically right or not, we must
not look merely to the particular act or saying, and ask
whether it is poetically good or bad. We must also con-
sider by whom it is said or done, to whom, when, by
what means, or for what end; whether, for instance, it
be to secure a greater good, or avert a greater evil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>Other difficulties may be resolved by due regard to
the usage of language. We may note a rare word, as in
ovpjas yey mparov, where the poet perhaps employs
ovpjas not in the sense of mules, but of sentinels. So,
again, of Dolon : <gloss>ill-favoured indeed he was to look upon.</gloss>
It is not meant that his body was ill-shaped, but that his
face was ugly; for the Cretans use the word εὐειδές,
<gloss>well-favoured</gloss>, to denote a fair face. Again, ζωρότερον
δὲ κέραιε, <gloss>mix the drink livelier,</gloss> does not mean <gloss>mix it stronger</gloss> as for hard drinkers, but <gloss>mix it quicker.</gloss>
</p></div>
<pb n="103"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>Sometimes an expression is metaphorical, as ‘ Now all
gods and men were sleeping through the night,-—-while at
the same time the poet says: ‘Often indeed as he turned
his gaze to the Trojan plain, he marvelled at the sound
of flutes and pipes,’ <gloss>All</gloss> is here used metaphorically
for <gloss>many,</gloss> all being a species of many. So in the
verse,—<gloss>alone she hath no part .. ,</gloss> οἴη, ‘alone, is
metaphorical; for the best known may be called the
only one.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>Again, the solution may depend upon accent or
breathing. Thus Hippias of Thasos solved the difficulties
in the lines,—δίδομεν (διδόμεν) δέ οἱ, and τὸ μὲν οὗ (οὐ)
καταπύθεται ὄμβρῳ.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Or again, the question may be solved by punctuation,
as in Empedocles,—<gloss>Of a sudden things became mortal
that before had learnt to be immortal, and things unmixed before mixed.</gloss></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>Or again, by ambiguity of meaning, —as
    παρῴχηκεν δὲ πλέω νύξ, where the word πλέω is
ambiguous.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>Or by the usage of language. Thus any mixed

drink is called οἶνος, <gloss>wine.</gloss> Hence Ganymede is said

<pb n="105"/>

<gloss>to pour the wine to Zeus,</gloss> though the gods do not
drink wine. So too workers in iron are called χαλκέας,
or workers in bronze. This, however, may also be taken
as a metaphor.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>Again, when a word seems to involve some incon-
sistency of meaning, we should consider how many
senses it may bear in the particular passage.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>For
example: <gloss>there was stayed the spear of bronze </gloss>—we
should ask in how many ways we may take <gloss>being
checked there.</gloss> The true mode of interpretation is the

1461b precise opposite of what Glaucon mentions. Critics, he
says, jump at certain groundless conclusions; they pass
adverse judgment and then proceed to reason on it; and,
assuming that the poet has said whatever they happen
to think, find fault if a thing is inconsistent with their
own fancy. The question about Icarius has been treated
in this fashion. The critics imagine he was a Lacedae-
monian. They think it strange, therefore, that Tele-
machus should not have met him when he went to
Lacedaemon. But the Cephallenian story may perhaps
be the true one. They allege that Odysseus took a wife
from among themselves, and that her father was Icadius
not Icarius. It is merely a mistake, then, that gives
plausibility to the objection.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>In general, the impossible must be justified by

reference to artistic requirements, or to the higher

<pb n="107"/>

reality, or to received opinion. With respect to the
requirements of art, a probable impossibility is to be
preferred to a thing improbable and yet possible. Again, °
it may be impossible that there should be men such as
Zeuxis painted. ‘Yes, we say, ‘but the impossible is
the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the
reality.’ To justify the irrational, we appeal to what is
commonly said to be. In addition to which, we urge
that the irrational sometimes does not violate reason ;
just as <gloss>it is probable that a thing may happen contrary
to probability.</gloss></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>Things that sound contradictory should be examined
by the same rules as in dialectical refutation—whether
the same thing is meant, in the same relation, and in the
same sense. We should therefore solve the question by
reference to what the poet says himself, or to what is
tacitly assumed by a person of intelligence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
<p>The element of the irrational, and, similarly, depravity
of character, are justly censured when there is no inner
necessity for introducing them. Such is the irrational
element in the introduction of Aegeus by Euripides and
the badness of Menelaus in the Orestes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
<p>Thus, there are five sources from which critical
objections are drawn. Things are censured either as
impossible, or irrational, or morally hurtful, or contra-
dictory, or contrary to artistic correctness. ‘ The answers
should be sought under the twelve heads above mentioned.

</p></div></div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>The question may be raised whether the Epic or
Tragic mode of imitation is the higher. If the more
refined art is the higher, and the more refined in every
case is that which appeals to the better sort of audience,

<pb n="109"/>

the art which imitates anything and everything is
manifestly most unrefined. The audience is supposed to
be too dull to comprehend unless something of their own
is thrown in by the performers, who therefore indulge
in restless movements. Bad flute-players twist and twirl,
if they have to represent <gloss>the quoit-throw,</gloss> or hustle the
coryphaeus when they perform the ‘Scylla.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>Tragedy,
it is said, has this same defect. We may compare the
opinion that the older actors entertained of their suc-
cessors. Mynniscus used to call Callippides <gloss>ape</gloss> on
account of the extravagance of his action, and the same

14628 View was held of Pindarus. Tragic art, then, as a whole,
stands to Epic in the same relation as the younger to
the elder actors. So we are told that Epic poetry is
addressed to a cultivated audience, who do not need
gesture; Tragedy, to an inferior public.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>Being then
unrefined, it is evidently the lower of the two.

Now, in the first place, this censure attaches not to
the poetic but to the histrionic art; for gesticulation
may be equally overdone in epic recitation, as by Sosi-
stratus, or in lyrical competition, as by Mnasitheus the
Opuntian. Next, all action is not to be condemned—-
any more than all dancing—but only that of bad per-
formers. Such was the fault found in Callippides, as
also in others of our own day, who are censured for
representing degraded women. Again, Tragedy like Epic
poetry produces its effect even’ without action; it reveals
its power by mere reading. If, then, in all other respects
it is superior, this fault, we say, is not inherent in it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>And superior it is, because it has all the epic
elements—it may even use the epic metre—with the

<pb n="111"/>

music and spectacular effects as important accessories ;
and these produce the most vivid of pleasures. Further,
it has vividness of impression in reading as well as in
representation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>Moreover, the art attains its end within

1462 Narrower limits; for the concentrated effect is more
pleasurable than one which is spread over a long time
and so diluted. What, for example, would be the effect
of the Oedipus of Sophocles, if it were cast into a form
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>as long as the Iliad? Once more, the Epic imitation
has less unity; as is shown by this, that any Epic poem
will furnish subjects for several tragedies. Thus if the
story adopted by the poet has a strict unity, it must
either be concisely told and appear truncated; or, if it
conform to the Epic canon of length, it must seem weak
and watery. <add>Such length implies some loss of unity,</add>
if, I mean, the poem is constructed out of several actions,
like the Iliad and the Odyssey, which have many such
parts, each with a certain magnitude of its own. Yet
these poems are as perfect as possible in structure; each
is, in the highest degree attainable, an imitation of a
single action.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>If, then, Tragedy is superior to Epic poetry in all these
respects, and, moreover, fulfils its specific function better
as an art—ffor each art ought to produce, not any chance
pleasure, but the pleasure proper to it,jas already stated
—it plainly follows that Tragedy is the higher art, as
attaining its end more perfectly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>Thus much may suffice concerning Tragic and Epics
poetry in general; their several kinds and parts, with
the number of each and their differences; the causes
that make a poem good or bad; the objections of the
critics and the answers to these objections, * * *
